                <p className=" text-lg">Generative AI is a type of computer program that can create new things, like pictures, stories, music, or even videos, based on patterns it has learned from lots of examples.

Generative AI works by understanding the rules of what makes something look like an animal, a song, or a story, and then using those rules to create something newâ€‹</p>
